Leap allows you to jump to any positions in the visible window / tab page 
area by entering a 2-character search pattern, and then potentially a "label" character to 
choose among multiple matches, similar to Sneak. The novel idea in Leap is its 
"clairvoyant" ability: it maps possible 
futures, and shows you which key(s) you will need to press before you actually need to do that.
